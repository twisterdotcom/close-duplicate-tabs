# Close Duplicate Tabs (Including Anchors)

A Chrome Extension that closes duplicate tabs, including those with different anchors/hashes. When duplicates are found, it keeps the tab with the highest anchor number (e.g., the latest GitHub comment).

- **100% Local**: All data stored locally on your device
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, telemetry, or external requests
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for review
- [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md)

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Duplicate Detection**: Detects duplicate tabs even when they have different anchors/hashes
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Handles URLs with different cases (e.g., `Expensify` vs `expensify`)
- **Works with Suspended Tabs**: Detects duplicates even in inactive tabs (Arc browser compatible)
- **Anchor Number Comparison**: Automatically keeps the tab with the highest number in the anchor (e.g., `#issuecomment-3595796076` vs `#issuecomment-3595795518`)
- **Visual Badge**: See duplicate count at a glance in the extension icon
- **Configurable Options**:
  - Ignore query parameters when comparing URLs
  - Ignore hash when comparing (but still uses it to determine which tab to keep)
  - Option to reload remaining tabs after closing duplicates
- **Reload All Tabs**: Quick button to reload all tabs in the current window

## Example Use Case

For GitHub issue tabs like:
- `https://github.com/Expensify/Expensify/issues/573091`
- `https://github.com/Expensify/Expensify/issues/573091#issuecomment-3595795518`
- `https://github.com/Expensify/Expensify/issues/573091#issuecomment-3595796076`

The extension will:
1. Recognize these as duplicates (same base URL)
2. Keep only: `https://github.com/Expensify/Expensify/issues/573091#issuecomment-3595796076` (highest anchor number)
3. Close the other two tabs

## 🚀 Installation

### From Source (Development)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/twisterdotcom/close-duplicate-tabs.git
   cd close-duplicate-tabs
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the extension directory
6. The extension should now be loaded

### From Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

The extension will be available on the Chrome Web Store soon. Check back for updates!

## How to Use

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Configure your preferences:
   - **Ignore query parameters**: When enabled, URLs with different query strings are treated as duplicates
   - **Ignore hash when comparing**: When enabled, URLs are compared without their hash, but the hash is still used to determine which tab to keep (highest number)
   - **Reload remaining tabs**: When enabled, remaining tabs will be reloaded after closing duplicates
3. Click "Close Duplicates" to remove duplicate tabs
4. Use "Reload All Tabs" to refresh all tabs in the current window

## Development

- Make changes to the files
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh icon on your extension card
- Test your changes

## How It Works

1. **URL Normalization**: URLs are normalized based on your settings (removing query/hash for comparison)
2. **Grouping**: Tabs are grouped by their normalized URL
3. **Anchor Extraction**: For each group, the extension extracts numbers from the anchor/hash
4. **Selection**: The tab with the highest anchor number is kept (or most recently accessed if no anchors)
5. **Cleanup**: All other tabs in the group are closed

## 🔐 Permissions

- **`tabs`**: Required to query open tabs and close duplicate tabs. Only accesses tabs in the current browser window.
- **`storage`**: Used to save your extension preferences locally. Only stores settings, no URLs or browsing data.
